## About

This project is a simple SwiftUI app that demonstrates how to use Combine to retrieve images of dogs from "TheDogAPI.com". The app fetches a list of dog breeds from the API and displays them in a scrollable list. When a breed is selected, the app retrieves a random image of a dog of that breed and displays it in a SwiftUI Image view.

The app is built using the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture pattern, with the ViewModel using Combine to handle the network requests and data processing. The code is written entirely in Swift, and uses Swift Package Manager to manage dependencies.

This project is a great starting point for anyone looking to learn Combine in SwiftUI, or for those looking to build a simple app that uses network requests to fetch data from an API.

If you have any questions or feedback, feel free to contact me at [your email here]. Thank you for checking out this project!
